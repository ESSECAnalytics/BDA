**The approach of the course is dynamics, and what you are expected to do will be explained during the first session.**  

Please already note that you are expected to have installed `R` and `R studio` prior the second session. And you should always download the data and script of a session before joining the class. In any case, you are invited to consult all the material in preparation of each class.

# GitHub ?

## What the hell is GitHub?

> GitHub is how people build software.  
-- GitHub

> GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of `Git` as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.  
-- Wikipedia

## Umm OK, but what is Git then?

> Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any files.  
-- Wikipedia

In short, GitHub offers a web-based platform to work with `Git`, a version control system used by software developers to work in team and keep track of code versions of the same project.

## Fine, but why should I need to use GitHub? I'm not a software developer.

For this course, we'll use GitHub as a code discussion platform among students. Nicolas's R codes are available in the `Code` tab and you can discuss them in the `Issues` section. Don't hesitate to ask for help, propose improvement or share your tips. **Remember that you should not share the solution, only tips when answering other's question**  

## Perfect, tell me how to use it GitHub.

It's simple.

**Global ESSECAnalytics account**  
[Repositories](https://github.com/ESSECAnalytics/) - All repositories hosted by the ESSEC Strategic Business Analytics Chair. This is where codes are shared and discussion happens. Each course has its own repository.   

**BDA repository**  
[Codes](https://github.com/ESSECAnalytics/BDA) - Nicolas's codes of the Big Data Analytics (BDA) course are available here.  
[Discussion](https://github.com/ESSECAnalytics/BDA/issues) - Where you can discuss codes, ask for help and share your thoughts. When you open a new issue, you can add a label (at the right of the edit box) (_help_, _question_, _bug_, _tips_...). For past discussions see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ESSECAnalytics/new/) **Remember: you should not share the solution, only tips when answering other's question**.  

## I mean... how to use GitHub in general o_O.

## Good. But it doesn't make sense to use GitHub without learning Git. Can I learn basic Git without wasting my all day?

## Not enough! I want to go further with Git / GitHub. Any tips?
